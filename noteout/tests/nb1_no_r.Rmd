# A heading

Some text.
More than one line.

::: {.notebook name="first_notebook"}
Here is a paragraph.

And another.
:::

More text.

Some thoughts.

On the other hand:

::: Python
This is a block for the Python version.
:::

The text continues; [More text]{.Python}. Continues.

Then we write: .

::: {.notebook name="second_notebook"}
Here, again, is a paragraph.

And, again, another.
:::

End of page.
