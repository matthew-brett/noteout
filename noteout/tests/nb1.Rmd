# A heading

Some text.
More than one line.

::: {.notebook name="first_notebook"}
Here is a paragraph.

And another.
:::

More text.

::: r
This is a block for the R version.
:::

Some thoughts.

::: r
This is another block for the R version.
:::

On the other hand:

::: python
This is a block for the Python version.
:::

The text continues; [This is *some text*]{.r}[More text]{.python}.  Continues.

Then we write: [more R]{.r}.

::: {.notebook name="second_notebook"}
Here, again, is a paragraph.

And, again, another.
:::

End of page.
